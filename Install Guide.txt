--HELP--

If the menu is working but the cheats are not visible in game, it likely means CS2 updated, you need to wait for the new file to be released on the website.

If you cannot see the watermark it means there was a problem with gameoverlay or antivirus is blocking 	the injection. In this case, you should uninstall your antivirus.
